# MedRAG-A-Multi-Modal-Retrieval-System-for-Medicine
The proposed project focuses on developing a Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for the medical domain. Traditional RAG systems are restricted to text-based retrieval, whereas medical knowledge exists in multiple forms such as research articles, radiology scans, and diagrams.
